# 2048-Torch

This is an attempt to teach a Reinforcement Learning model using a Deep Q Network to play 2048.  I've written all of the code from scratch, with significant help from a couple of sites:
1. [Torch RL Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html)
2. [Towards Data Science/Medium post on Deep Q Networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-explained-visually-part-5-deep-q-networks-step-by-step-5a5317197f4b/).

As of now, things seem to be 'working' in the sense that I am getting the right objects in the right places and all that, but it won't really learn anything and I'm not sure why yet.  It has typically been learning enough to be almost, but not quite, as good as picking moves entirely at random.  Which is not good. ðŸ¤·

More later as things improve...
